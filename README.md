# React-NoteTaking
This is where I share my thoughts on React

STEP 1) INSTALL REACT

$ npm install -g create-react-app

STEP 2) CREATE PROJECT FOLDER

$ create-react-app robofriends

cd into robofriends and see packages, react and dependencies already created. A robofriends folder is also created in your dir. Now drag the folder to submlime text

$ ls

node_modules/  package.json  package-lock.json  public/  README.md  src/

Open the robofriends or newreact folder in Sublime text. Check json file to see all the dependencies created etc

package-lock.json file has all the version nos of your dependencies and makes sure they are locked in

.gitignore: It has files it has to ignore. It is auto generated

STEP 3)

$ npm start

> newreact@0.1.0 start C:\Users\AbdulRahman Abu\desktop\newreact
> react-scripts start

 Starting the development server...

Compiled with warnings.
......

The browser will be loaded and the react engine and logo shows
